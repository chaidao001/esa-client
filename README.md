This project is built on Python 3.5.

The client has a cache object that holds market definitions and prices.  

It supports connect, authenticate, subscribe, heartbeat, resubscribe, and disconnect via method calls or user inputs from the console.

Run python Main.py to start.  Market ids could be defined there.
